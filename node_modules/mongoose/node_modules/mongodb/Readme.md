# Installation
=======
Up to date documentation
========================

[Documentation](http://mongodb.github.com/node-mongodb-native/)

Install
=======
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

The recommended way to get started using the Node.js 3.0 driver is by using the `npm` (Node Package Manager) to install the dependency in your project.

## MongoDB Driver

Given that you have created your own project using `npm init` we install the MongoDB driver and its dependencies by executing the following `npm` command.

```bash
npm install mongodb --save
```

This will download the MongoDB driver and add a dependency entry in your `package.json` file.

<<<<<<< HEAD
You can also use the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en) package manager.

## Troubleshooting
=======
Community
=========
Check out the google group [node-mongodb-native](http://groups.google.com/group/node-mongodb-native) for questions/answers from users of the driver.

Live Examples
============
<a href="https://runnable.com/node-mongodb-native" target="_blank"><img src="https://runnable.com/external/styles/assets/runnablebtn.png" style="width:67px;height:25px;"></a>

Introduction
============
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

The MongoDB driver depends on several other packages. These are:

* [mongodb-core](https://github.com/mongodb-js/mongodb-core)
* [bson](https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson)
* [kerberos](https://github.com/mongodb-js/kerberos)
* [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)

<<<<<<< HEAD
The `kerberos` package is a C++ extension that requires a build environment to be installed on your system. You must be able to build Node.js itself in order to compile and install the `kerberos` module. Furthermore, the `kerberos` module requires the MIT Kerberos package to correctly compile on UNIX operating systems. Consult your UNIX operation system package manager for what libraries to install.
=======
```javascript
  var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient
    , format = require('util').format;    
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

**Windows already contains the SSPI API used for Kerberos authentication. However, you will need to install a full compiler tool chain using Visual Studio C++ to correctly install the Kerberos extension.**

### Diagnosing on UNIX

<<<<<<< HEAD
If you don’t have the build-essentials, this module won’t build. In the case of Linux, you will need gcc, g++, Node.js with all the headers and Python. The easiest way to figure out what’s missing is by trying to build the Kerberos project. You can do this by performing the following steps.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mongodb-js/kerberos
cd kerberos
npm install
```
=======
      // Locate all the entries using find
      collection.find().toArray(function(err, results) {
        console.dir(results);
        // Let's close the db
        db.close();
      });      
    });
  })
```

Data types
==========
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

If all the steps complete, you have the right toolchain installed. If you get the error "node-gyp not found," you need to install `node-gyp` globally:

```bash
npm install -g node-gyp
```

If it correctly compiles and runs the tests you are golden. We can now try to install the `mongod` driver by performing the following command.

```bash
cd yourproject
npm install mongodb --save
```

If it still fails the next step is to examine the npm log. Rerun the command but in this case in verbose mode.

```bash
npm --loglevel verbose install mongodb
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
This will print out all the steps npm is performing while trying to install the module.
=======
The C/C++ bson parser/serializer
--------------------------------
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

### Diagnosing on Windows

A compiler tool chain known to work for compiling `kerberos` on Windows is the following.

* Visual Studio C++ 2010 (do not use higher versions)
* Windows 7 64bit SDK
* Python 2.7 or higher

<<<<<<< HEAD
Open the Visual Studio command prompt. Ensure `node.exe` is in your path and install `node-gyp`.
=======
GitHub information
==================
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

```bash
npm install -g node-gyp
```

Next, you will have to build the project manually to test it. Clone the repo, install dependencies and rebuild:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/christkv/kerberos.git
cd kerberos
npm install
node-gyp rebuild
```

This should rebuild the driver successfully if you have everything set up correctly.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Other possible issues
=======
Examples
========
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

Your Python installation might be hosed making gyp break. Test your deployment environment first by trying to build Node.js itself on the server in question, as this should unearth any issues with broken packages (and there are a lot of broken packages out there).

Another tip is to ensure your user has write permission to wherever the Node.js modules are being installed.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Quick Start
=======
GridStore
=========
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

This guide will show you how to set up a simple application using Node.js and MongoDB. Its scope is only how to set up the driver and perform the simple CRUD operations. For more in-depth coverage, see the [tutorials](docs/reference/content/tutorials/main.md).

### Create the `package.json` file

First, create a directory where your application will live.

```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Enter the following command and answer the questions to create the initial structure for your new project:

```bash
npm init
```

Next, install the driver dependency.
=======
Replicasets
===========
For more information about how to connect to a replicaset have a look at the extensive documentation [Documentation](http://mongodb.github.com/node-mongodb-native/)

Primary Key Factories
---------------------
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

```bash
npm install mongodb --save
```

You should see **NPM** download a lot of files. Once it's done you'll find all the downloaded packages under the **node_modules** directory.

### Start a MongoDB Server

For complete MongoDB installation instructions, see [the manual](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/).

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Download the right MongoDB version from [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
2. Create a database directory (in this case under **/data**).
3. Install and start a ``mongod`` process.
=======
  MongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test', function(err, db) {
    if(err) throw err;
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

```bash
mongod --dbpath=/data
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
You should see the **mongod** process start up and print some status information.

### Connect to MongoDB
=======
Documentation
=============
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

Create a new **app.js** file and add the following code to try out some basic CRUD
operations using the MongoDB driver.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Add code to connect to the server and the database **myproject**:
=======
Find
----
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

// Database Name
const dbName = 'myproject';

// Use connect method to connect to the server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log("Connected successfully to server");

  const db = client.db(dbName);

  client.close();
});
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Run your app from the command line with:

```bash
node app.js
```

The application should print **Connected successfully to server** to the console.

### Insert a Document

Add to **app.js** the following function which uses the **insertMany**
method to add three documents to the **documents** collection.  

```js
const insertDocuments = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  const collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Insert some documents
  collection.insertMany([
    {a : 1}, {a : 2}, {a : 3}
  ], function(err, result) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    assert.equal(3, result.result.n);
    assert.equal(3, result.ops.length);
    console.log("Inserted 3 documents into the collection");
    callback(result);
=======
Useful chainable methods of cursor. These can optionally be options of `find` instead of method calls:

  * `.limit(n).skip(m)` to control paging.
  * `.sort(fields)` Order by the given fields. There are several equivalent syntaxes:
  * `.sort({field1: -1, field2: 1})` descending by field1, then ascending by field2.
  * `.sort([['field1', 'desc'], ['field2', 'asc']])` same as above
  * `.sort([['field1', 'desc'], 'field2'])` same as above
  * `.sort('field1')` ascending by field1

Other options of `find`:

* `fields` the fields to fetch (to avoid transferring the entire document)
* `tailable` if true, makes the cursor [tailable](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Tailable+Cursors).
* `batchSize` The number of the subset of results to request the database
to return for every request. This should initially be greater than 1 otherwise
the database will automatically close the cursor. The batch size can be set to 1
with `batchSize(n, function(err){})` after performing the initial query to the database.
* `hint` See [Optimization: hint](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Optimization#Optimization-Hint).
* `explain` turns this into an explain query. You can also call
`explain()` on any cursor to fetch the explanation.
* `snapshot` prevents documents that are updated while the query is active
from being returned multiple times. See more
[details about query snapshots](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/How+to+do+Snapshotted+Queries+in+the+Mongo+Database).
* `timeout` if false, asks MongoDb not to time out this cursor after an
inactivity period.


For information on how to create queries, see the
[MongoDB section on querying](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Querying).

```javascript
  var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient
    , format = require('util').format;    

  MongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test', function(err, db) {
    if(err) throw err;

    var collection = db
      .collection('test')
      .find({})
      .limit(10)
      .toArray(function(err, docs) {
        console.dir(docs);
    });
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose
  });
}
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
The **insert** command returns an object with the following fields:
=======
Insert
------
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

* **result** Contains the result document from MongoDB
* **ops** Contains the documents inserted with added **_id** fields
* **connection** Contains the connection used to perform the insert

Add the following code to call the **insertDocuments** function:

```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

<<<<<<< HEAD
// Database Name
const dbName = 'myproject';
=======
* `safe:true` Should always set if you have a callback.
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

// Use connect method to connect to the server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log("Connected successfully to server");

  const db = client.db(dbName);

  insertDocuments(db, function() {
    client.close();
  });
});
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Run the updated **app.js** file:

```bash
node app.js
```

The operation returns the following output:

```bash
Connected successfully to server
Inserted 3 documents into the collection
```
=======
Note that there's no reason to pass a callback to the insert or update commands
unless you use the `safe:true` option. If you don't specify `safe:true`, then
your callback will be called immediately.

Update; update and insert (upsert)
----------------------------------

The update operation will update the first document that matches your query
(or all documents that match if you use `multi:true`).
If `safe:true`, `upsert` is not set, and no documents match, your callback will return 0 documents updated.
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

### Find All Documents

Add a query that returns all the documents.

```js
const findDocuments = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  const collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Find some documents
  collection.find({}).toArray(function(err, docs) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    console.log("Found the following records");
    console.log(docs)
    callback(docs);
  });
}
```

This query returns all the documents in the **documents** collection. Add the **findDocument** method to the **MongoClient.connect** callback:

<<<<<<< HEAD
```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');
=======
* `safe:true` Should always set if you have a callback.
* `multi:true` If set, all matching documents are updated, not just the first.
* `upsert:true` Atomically inserts the document if no documents matched.
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

// Database Name
const dbName = 'myproject';

// Use connect method to connect to the server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log("Connected correctly to server");

  const db = client.db(dbName);

  insertDocuments(db, function() {
    findDocuments(db, function() {
      client.close();
    });
  });
});
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Find Documents with a Query Filter
=======
Find and modify
---------------

`findAndModify` is like `update`, but it also gives the updated document to
your callback. But there are a few key differences between findAndModify and
update:
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

Add a query filter to find only documents which meet the query criteria.

```js
const findDocuments = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  const collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Find some documents
  collection.find({'a': 3}).toArray(function(err, docs) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    console.log("Found the following records");
    console.log(docs);
    callback(docs);
  });
}
```

Only the documents which match ``'a' : 3`` should be returned.

### Update a document

The following operation updates a document in the **documents** collection.

```js
const updateDocument = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  const collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Update document where a is 2, set b equal to 1
  collection.updateOne({ a : 2 }
    , { $set: { b : 1 } }, function(err, result) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    assert.equal(1, result.result.n);
    console.log("Updated the document with the field a equal to 2");
    callback(result);
  });  
}
```

The method updates the first document where the field **a** is equal to **2** by adding a new field **b** to the document set to **1**. Next, update the callback function from **MongoClient.connect** to include the update method.

```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

// Database Name
const dbName = 'myproject';

// Use connect method to connect to the server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log("Connected successfully to server");

  const db = client.db(dbName);

  insertDocuments(db, function() {
    updateDocument(db, function() {
      client.close();
    });
  });
});
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Remove a document

Remove the document where the field **a** is equal to **3**.

```js
const removeDocument = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  const collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Delete document where a is 3
  collection.deleteOne({ a : 3 }, function(err, result) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    assert.equal(1, result.result.n);
    console.log("Removed the document with the field a equal to 3");
    callback(result);
  });    
}
```
=======
Save
----
>>>>>>> parent of bf65d55... Trying to figure out mongoose

Add the new method to the **MongoClient.connect** callback function.

<<<<<<< HEAD
```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');
=======
Sponsors
========
Just as Felix Geisendörfer I'm also working on the driver for my own startup and this driver is a big project that also benefits other companies who are using MongoDB.

If your company could benefit from a even better-engineered node.js mongodb driver I would appreciate any type of sponsorship you may be able to provide. All the sponsors will get a lifetime display in this readme, priority support and help on problems and votes on the roadmap decisions for the driver. If you are interested contact me on [christkv AT g m a i l.com](mailto:christkv@gmail.com) for details.

And I'm very thankful for code contributions. If you are interested in working on features please contact me so we can discuss API design and testing.

### Index a Collection

[Indexes](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/indexes/) can improve your application's
performance. The following function creates an index on the **a** field in the
**documents** collection.

```js
const indexCollection = function(db, callback) {
  db.collection('documents').createIndex(
    { "a": 1 },
      null,
      function(err, results) {
        console.log(results);
        callback();
    }
  );
};
```

Add the ``indexCollection`` method to your app:
